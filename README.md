# Image Processing Face Detection

This project uses OpenCV and Python to detect faces in images. The OpenCV library is used for image processing, and the Python programming language to implement the face detection algorithm.

## Lessons Learned

Lessons learnt from this project include the importance of pre-processing images before applying face detection algorithms, and the need to consider different parameters when applying face detection algorithms. Additionally, it is important to consider performance when using image processing algorithms.
